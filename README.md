### Built With

* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

The dapp is a client side only poject and is built using the Create React App scripts.

Follow the next step to start using this dapp or follow the next tutorial on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkjUmBsmQYM&feature=youtu.be&ab_channel=ElrondNetwork)

### Prerequisites

For *development* you will need to have the following:

* node version 12.13.0
* npm

### Instalation and running

### Step 1. Install modules
From a terminal, navigate to the project folder and run ```npm install```

### Step 2. Update Configs

In the application's src folder there are 3 config files (config.internal.ts, config.testnet.ts, config.mainnet.ts).

Based on the environment used the configs will need to be updated:
- multisigContract : should contain the address of the Multisig Smart Contract received after the creation of Multisig Smart Contract
- also check the walletAddress, apiAddress and explorerAddress

### Step 3. Run locally

To run the project locally run ```npm run start``` from the project folder. This will start the React app in development mode, using the configs found in the config.ts file.

### Step 4. Build for production

A build of the app is necessary to deploy to production.

The dapp is configured with build scripts targeting either an internal (local) testnet, the public testnet or the public devnet.

For internal run => ```npm run build-internal``` (for internal build the package.json script for start will need to be updated and remove the Https restriction)

For testnet run => ```npm run build-testnet```

For mainnet run => ```npm run build-mainnet```
